    Configurable Work Speeds lets you adjust multipliers for all major work speed-related stats in RimWorld and compatible mods.
    - Supports RimWorld 1.6 and HugsLib (required)
    - Optional live configuration via UINotIncluded
    - Automatically detects and supports custom work speed StatDefs from other mods in most cases.
    - If you want to add custom work speed StatDefs, see the extension point below.
    - This mod is open source and available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/CornerJockeys/ConfigurableWorkSpeeds">https://github.com/Corners/ConfigurableWorkSpeeds</a>
    - This is my first mod, so please report any issues or suggestions!

    Logging:
    This mod logs important events, stat detection, and multiplier changes to RimWorld's log file. You can view these messages in the in-game log window (press Ctrl+F12) or by checking the log file at:
    <RimWorld install folder>/RimWorldWin64_data/output_log.txt (Windows)
    This helps with troubleshooting, tracking how multipliers are applied and could point to potential reasons for crashes.

    Extension Point:
    Other mods can add new StatDefs with relevant keywords/categories, and Configurable Work Speeds will automatically provide sliders for them in the mod options menu. See documentation for details.
